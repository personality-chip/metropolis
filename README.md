**Metropolis** is a high-performance, narrative-driven system monitor built for the terminal. It transcends traditional hardware monitoring by transforming raw kernel metrics into a living, breathing **Cyberpunk Skyline**. 

Every flicker of a neon sign, every shuttle streaking across the sky, and every drop of rain is a direct reflection of your system's heartbeat.

## Demos

## Features

- **Dynamic Branding**: The central monolith automatically detects your OS and brands itself accordingly (or override it with your own).
- **CPU (The Heartbeat)**: High utility triggers "Rush Hour"—flooding sky-lanes with high-speed traffic and increasing pedestrian density.
- **Disk I/O (Logistics)**: Intense activity triggers **Heavy Industrial Shuttles**. Watch long-haulers move "physical data" across the district.
- **RAM (Illumination)**: Memory usage dictates the overall occupancy and glow of the city's monoliths.
- **Neon Signage**: Secondary buildings display your **Top CPU Processes** as vibrant neon signs.
- **Dynamic Pursuits**: Random high-stakes police chases streak across the skyline. Look for the **Red Fugitive** and **Interceptor** units.
- **Procedural Night**: Window patterns and traffic cycles are session-unique.
- **Fully Customizable**: Swap themes, toggle weather, and fine-tune simulation density via a simple `config.toml` or CLI flags.

## Installation

### One-Line Install (Linux / macOS)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5c0/metropolis/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Crates.io
```bash
cargo install metropolis-tui
```

### Arch Linux (AUR)
```bash
yay -S metropolis
```

### Homebrew (macOS)
```bash
brew install 5c0/tap/metropolis
```

### Windows (winget)
```bash
winget install 5c0.Metropolis
```

### Nix / NixOS (Flake)
Run directly without installing:
```bash
nix run github:5c0/metropolis
```

Or add to your `flake.nix` inputs:
```nix
inputs.metropolis.url = "github:5c0/metropolis";
```
Then add to `environment.systemPackages`:
```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  inputs.metropolis.packages.${system}.default
];
```

### Build from Source
*Requires [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and `cargo` to be installed.*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/5c0/metropolis.git
cd metropolis
cargo run --release
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|:---:|:---|
| `q` | **Escape the city** (Quit) |
| `r` | **Atmospheric Shift** (Toggle Rain) |
| `s` | **Cryo Shift** (Toggle Snow) |
| `d` | **Core Diagnostics** (Debug Overlay) |

---

## Configuration

Metropolis automatically creates its default `config.toml` on first run:

| OS | Config Path |
|:---|:---|
| **Linux** | `~/.config/metropolis/` |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/Metropolis/` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\Metropolis\` |

You can customize almost everything:
- **Themes**: Switch between built-in themes (`matrix`, `cyberpunk`, `sin_city`, `dracula`, `synthwave`) or write your own.
- **The Monolith**: Override the OS detection to force a specific logo, or change the neon text.
- **Environment**: Force `rain`, `snow`, or `clear` skies, and toggle terminal transparency.
- **Simulation**: Tune the maximum number of vehicles, pedestrians, and weather density.

For a full list of options, check `assets/config_template.toml`. You can also override any of these settings at runtime with flags (e.g., `--theme matrix`). Run `metropolis --help` for the full list.

### Custom Themes
You can build your own themes to customize the entire color palette—from the main building's neon signs to the street lamps, weather particles, shuttle traffic, and much more.

Drop custom `.toml` files into the `themes/` directory next to your config file. [Share your city](https://github.com/5c0/metropolis/discussions/categories/theme-gallery) in the Theme Gallery!
